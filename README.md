# Availity Frontend Engineer Assigment by Ana Berrocal

## 1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement. It can also be a personal or school project.
    My proudest professional achievement to date is having switched careers from a non-tech field into becoming a software engineer. It’s something that is still surreal to me from time to time and I feel proud and grateful to be where I am in my life and career.

    A more technical professional achievement has been creating and developing an application for a large enterprise that believed they couldn’t achieve what they were looking to do and were ready to give up and look for alternative ways to complete their project since at least 2 or 3 other agencies had told them that it "couldn't be done". With this knowledge, I was given the task of implementing a CMS and an e-commerce platform as separate databases into a custom build UI and not only I was able to achieve that but also gained the company I am currently at the business of this enterprise to build this project.

## 2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc) 
    There are a few articles that have recently created an impact on how I design and develop UI’s and user experiences lately:- The one that I come back to often and even point other engineers to is this article on how to design and build the best experience for users within forms: https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/guides/great-form-ui-and-ux/
    Another great book is “The design of everyday things” by Don Norman.

## 3. How would you explain what Availity does to your grandmother? 
    There is an extensive number of insurance providers in the United States (Aetna, Humana, United Health, etc), these insurance providers often need 'programs' (software) to register new patients, manage existing patients and claims, for when patients need to find a care provider, etc. Availity provides these insurance companies with the right 'computer programs' and tools for their needs. And I basically build the programs and tools that Availity provides to these insurance providers.

## 4. Coding exercise: You are tasked to write a checker that validates the parentheses of a LISP code.  Write a program (in Java or JavaScript) which takes in a string as an input and returns true if all the parentheses in the string are properly closed and nested.
    Please find the solution for this coding exercise in the parenthesisChecker.js file within the parentheses-checker-assignment directory. This file can be ran by running the following commands:
      cd parentheses-checker-assignment
      node parenthesesChecker.js

## 5. Coding exercise: For frontend engineer: Healthcare providers request to be part of the Availity system.  Using a modern JavaScript framework (React preferred, or Vue or Angular), create a registration user interface so healthcare providers can electronically join Availity. The following data points should be collected: First Name, Last Name, NPI number, Business Address, Telephone Number, Email address.
    This is a React application that simulates a registration form for a healthcare provider to join Availity. I used Material-UI as a styling library, Formik library and Yup JavaScript Schema.
